# DIP-highlighting

The plan for this project is to be a side executable/library that provides syntax highlighting for the DIP editor.

The highlighter will be based on tree sitter and pygments for the syntax highlighting with tree sitter being the first choice for the highlighting. The hope is to unify the tags into a single format that can be used by the DIP editor.
